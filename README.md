# HelloWorldWebServiceRPC

This is a simple and quick learning project to understand how Web Services and their clients can be created.

Steps:

1. Clone this project

2. Import it into Eclipse by selecting File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace

3. Run HelloWorldPublisher.java as Java application first and wait for a couple of seconds. It will publish the web service.

4. Then run HelloWorldClient.java as Java application and it should consume the web service and print the response.

NOTE: This application is written with Java 8 and it should work fine with Java 7 as well. But no guarantees!
